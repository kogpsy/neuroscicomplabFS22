# Bayesian models of perception

Bayesian inference provides a recipe for optimally combining prior knowledge with new sensory observations and it has the potential to provide significant insight into perception (e.g., Kersten, Mamassian, & Yuille, 2004; Knill & Richards, 1996).

- the ‘Bayesian Brain’ hypothesis

In the perceptual domain, the core assertions are that: (a) an observer has an internal mental model which represents the processes that gave rise to their sensory observations, (b) that observers conduct Bayesian inference using their mental model in order to infer probable states of the world from sensory data, and (c) that observers have prior beliefs over states of the world.
