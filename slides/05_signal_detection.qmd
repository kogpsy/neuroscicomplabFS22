## Signal detection theory

- What happpens when a person must whether or not an event has occured, using information that insufficient to determine the answer?

- Signal detection theory is a widely-used method for analyzing this type of situation and of separating characteristics of the signal from those of the person who is detecting it.

- We can begin to investigate how information is used to guide a decision.

**What is a decision?**

- A doctor is examining a patient and trying to make a diagnosis.

- A witness to a crime is asked to identify a suspect. Was this person present at the time of the crime or not?

- Purchase decision, gambling decisions, perceptual decisions, etc.

### Assumptions of SDT

**The key assumptions of SDT**

- Separate representation and decision-making.

- Signal and noise trials can be represented as values along a uni-dimensional ‚Äústrength‚Äù construct.

- Both types trials produce Gaussian random variables that represent strength. 

- Both variances are assumed to be the same.

- The decision-making assumption of is that yes and no responses are produced by comparing the strength of the current trial to a fixed criterion. If the strength exceeds the criterion a ‚Äúyes‚Äù response is made, otherwise a ‚Äúno‚Äù response is made.

::: {.even-even-smaller}

- The mean of the signal distribution is `d'`. This makes `d'` a measure of the discriminability of the signal trials from the noise trials -- it corresponds to the distance between the two distributions.

- The strength value `d/2` is special, because it is the criterion value that maximizes the probability of a correct classification when signal and noise trials are equally likely to occur.

- `c` a measure of bias, because it corresponds to how different the actual criterion is from the unbiased one. Positive values of c correspond to a bias towards saying no, and so to an increase in correct rejections at the expense of an increase in misses. Negative values of c correspond to a bias towards saying yes, and so to an increase in hits at the expense of an increase in false alarms.

  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = pnorm, colour = "steelblue3", 
                  args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1),
                  size = 1.5) +
  labs(y = "Probability", x = "Z Score") +

## Using Signal Detection to Analyze Data in R

We will look at an example using data from a recognition memory test.

- Subjects first learn words (study phase).

- In the test phase, they are presented with words that were on the list, and with new words.

- Subjects have to classify words into 
    + `old` (yes, this was on the list) 
    + `new` (no, this wasn't on the list)
    
- These kind of data are usually analyzed using a Signal Detection model.
